# 🪖 Helmet Detection using Deep Learning (YOLOv8)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **deep learning–based helmet detection system** using **YOLOv8**. The model automatically detects whether workers are wearing safety helmets in images or videos, aiming to enhance workplace safety through computer vision.

## 🚀 Features

* Detects helmets in images
* Fast and lightweight YOLOv8n model
* High accuracy for real-time applications
* Simple deployment using Hugging Face Spaces

* **Variant Used:** YOLOv8n (nano)
* **Type:** One-stage object detection model

## 📂 Dataset

* **Type:** Image dataset
* **Annotations:** YOLO format (bounding boxes)
* **Classes:**

  * Helmet
  * Person (optional)

### Dataset Split
